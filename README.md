Making a database using C++!

## Challenge 
- The challenge in this project is to make a database using the programming language C++.
- Even though SQL is mostly used to create and maintain databases, we are gonna think out of the box and use C++.
- We are also going to implement different text files.


## Output
- The program will show the available actions the user can make, including an option to exit the program, and an admin view so the user can see all the information stored.
- The program will prompt the user to enter the number of the assigned options they want to choose.
